I was having this weird issue where VS Code was showing me errors on files that were recently deleted. I found that restarting VS Code would fix it, but it turns out you can also just reload the window and it does the same thing. 

You can reload the VS Code window using:

- Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`): Type "Reload Window" and select it

This will refresh VS Code's view of your workspace and clear any cached file states.

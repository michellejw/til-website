I like nice-looking code, but I am not great at writing it that way. So I love a tool that can auto-format for me. I'm primarily a Python programmer, and the analagous package there I'd say would be Black. Prettier is like Black but is made for web languages like css, html, javascript, etc. 

Any time I write in javascript it looks terrible. I don't know why. Maybe all the nested things??

There's an extension in VS Code (and probably lots of other IDEs) where you can set it up to format on save.
